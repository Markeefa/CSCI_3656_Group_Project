About the charnley rmsd python package:

RMSD stands for root-mean-square deviation, which the package calculates using either the Kabsch algorithm or he Quaternion algorithm. They help use solve problems that are encountered using space rotation. This should result in minimal RMSD. 

This python package helps us to calculate the structural difference between two molecules. Re-centering and rotating helps us get a true minimal RMSD, whereas without this you would get a value that is too big.
