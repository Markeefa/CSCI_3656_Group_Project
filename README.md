About the charnley rmsd python package:

RMSD stands for root-mean-square deviation, which the package calculates using either the Kabsch algorithm or the Quaternion algorithm. They help use solve problems that are encountered using space rotation. This should result in minimal RMSD. 

This python package helps us to calculate the structural difference between two molecules. Re-centering and rotating helps us get a true minimal RMSD, whereas without this you would get a value that is too big. 

Research: 

We will find data on a protein molecule that we might want to use to research the behavior of the two algorithms. We will start by downloading data from AlphaFold and running it with our package.
